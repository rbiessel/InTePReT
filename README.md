# InTePReT
InSAR Triplet Prediction &amp; Regression Tools

The aim of this repository is to provide a means of dealing with systematic closure phases in InSAR timseries analyses.

This repository will provide a modular means of predicting, inverting, and analysizing systematic closure phases. The idea is that functions from this repository may be used in conjunction with other timeseries estimators such as ML/EMI or even SBAS networks.

I also intend this repository to supercede the experimental code in `CovSAR`.

I will update this README with documentation and requirements once the code is in a mature and usable state.
