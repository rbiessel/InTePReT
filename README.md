# InTeRPreT
InSAR Triplet Regression & Prediction Tools

This repository will provide a modular means of predicting, inverting, and analysizing systematic InSAR closure phases. The idea is that this repository may be used in conjunction with other timeseries estimators such as ML/EMI or even SBAS networks.

I also intend this repository to supercede the experimental code in `CovSAR`.

I will update this README with documentation and requirements once the code is in a mature and usable state.


Goals:

Provide a home for the intensity triplet first utilized in `CovSAR`.
Implement additional triplets, providing a means of ingesting external data such as reanalysis or NDVI
Be modular with timeseries packages such as MintPY, GREG, and more
Implemented at pixel-by-pixel level but scalable to whole stacks (likely two different functions)


Would be Nice:
Both python and julia support
